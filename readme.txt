This is a project for EE4330 Telecommunication.
By: Chi Shing Poon (1001082535) 
This project a few digital communication system techniques: Sampling, Quantization, PCM, DPCM, Line Encoding, FSK Modulation, SNR illustrations.
Each Matlab file is independent, the only file they need to read from this folder is the lena image ('lena512color.tff')


Matlab Code:
Part B:
UsedPCM 	- PCM Code with the quantization used throughout the project
PCM1 		- PCM Code with experimental quantization code, which was later dropped and became unused.
Part C:
DPCMfirst 	- DPCM with first order linear predictor
DPCMThird 	- DPCM with third order linear predictor
Part D: 
RCFOnOff 	- On Off line code with Raised Cosine Filter
RCFBIPOLAR 	- Bipolar Line code with Raised Cosine Filter
Part E:
BFSKOnOff	- BFSK Applied to On Off Line Code
BFSKBipolar 	- BFSK Applied to bipolar line code
